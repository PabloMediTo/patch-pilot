# Review Screen

## Responsibility

Present the persisted [change proposal](../DICTIONARY.md#change-proposal), [verification evidence](../DICTIONARY.md#verification-evidence), and ordered [run timeline](../DICTIONARY.md#run-timeline) needed for one human [approval decision](../DICTIONARY.md#approval-decision).

## Not responsible for

- deciding whether a proposal is correct
- implementing the database adapter that atomically persists an approval decision
- publishing a branch or pull request
- treating Redis live events as canonical evidence

## Inputs

- run identity and current state
- ordered timeline events
- implementation plan and unified diff
- bounded verification evidence
- an existing approval decision, when present

## Outputs

- an immutable review view model
- escaped server-deliverable HTML with timeline, plan, semantic diff lines, and test evidence
- approve and reject form actions only while the run is awaiting its first decision

## Adjacent parts

- the API supplies authenticated persisted evidence and live timeline events
- the approval use case validates the first human action and delegates atomic persistence
- GitHub delivery consumes only an approved result

## Current enforcement boundary

The web application implements and tests the framework-independent view model and HTML rendering. All repository and agent-authored text is escaped before insertion. Decided or non-reviewable runs do not expose approval actions. The maintenance package now validates the first decision, requires rejection reasons, supports idempotent request replay, and rejects competing decisions through an atomic persistence port. API data loading, the concrete persistence adapter, live browser updates, submission handling, and visual styling remain open.
